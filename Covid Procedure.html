<center> <Font size="+4"> <b> <br>These are the changes made to the pickup procedure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Updated May 2023.) </font> </center> </b> <br> <br>

<Font size="+2">

Please read this carefully. This is all new and very important. I'm sorry it's long.  <br> <br>


?? Important ??  <br> <br>

You will need a carrier for the rats. Please have bedding and food in it. (A water bottle will leak so it's not needed. If you are concerned you can put in cucumbers or apples for hydration.) If it is cold please have some fleece or other nesting material in it so they can keep warm. You can put on a tiny box as a hide.  <br> <br>

I'm going to continue with the plan of not doing visits and just having the babies ready for curbside pickup. I'll have you text me when you arrive then I will bring the babies out and put them in your carrier. (If you want me to wear a mask please let me know before hand.)  <br> <br>

Due to not being able to have visits I will make videos of the babies and uploaded them to YouTube. I can also do video chat or a phone call when you're home if you have any questions or concerns.   <br> <br>


?? Pickup Instructions ??  <br> <br>

I do appointments in 10 minute intervals. Please try to be on time for your appointment. If you're early or late you may have to wait a few minutes. I appreciate your patience.  <br> <br>

Please try to park as close to my address as possible so I do not have to walk the babies far if the weather is inclement. There is a driveway to the left of my house (when facing my house) that you can park in front of as well. (We share it with the neighbor and pickup will be quick.)  <br> <br>

Please stay in your car. Please do not come up on the porch. Once you arrive please text me your name, the Rat Mom's name, and your baby numbers. (So, "Hi, it's April. I'm here for Luna's Girl One and Girl Two.") I will then bring the babies out to your vehicle. I will transfer them into your carrier for you as too keep everything safe. I do not want them to startle or escape.  <br> <br>

I don't recommend taking the babies out in the car as they will be scared and they may escape.  <br> <br>


?? Rats & COVID ??  <br> <br>

If you are concerned about the rats having COVID on them you can put the babies in their cage and wash your hands. You can wait the longest time given that the virus survives on surfaces (three to five days) to hold them if you are concerned. Just wash your hands after caring for them.  <br> <br>

Due to me not being sick (I do check my temperature and my husband's temperature regularly, plus my husband has regular covid tests for work) there should be very little to no risk. But it is all at your discretion and what you're comfortable with. However please please do not bathe the rats or try to sanitize them. (The sanitizer will most likely irritate their skin and respiratory system. They may ingest some of the sanitizer when they lick themselves and become sick.) Bathing can be stressful and they can inhale water and develop pneumonia. They will be stressed going to a new home with new smells and noises. So a bath may be too much for them and cause a mycoplasma flare up.  <br> <br>

As far as the rats and the Corona virus there isn't any info out there saying you should do anything differently with them or their care. The CDC has not issued any news on animals getting COVID-19. Just practice good hygiene (washing your hand before and after handling the rats, keep the cage clean, and wash your hands after touching anything to do with the rats, etc.). I do not recommend bathing the rats at all because as I said that can cause stress induced mycoplasma flare ups or they can inhale some water and that causes respiratory infections/pneumonia.  <br> <br>
