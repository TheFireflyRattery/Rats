<b> <font color="F52887"> If you change your choice of food, bedding, or cage you must notify me immediately to get the change approved. Your application was approved based on the supplies you filled out the application with. It does not cover any undisclosed changes. I highly recommend getting the change (especially a cage change) approved before purchasing. </font color> </b> <br> <br>

If you are under 18 or still live with a parent/guardian I will have to talk to them on the phone to make sure it is ok that you are getting rats. <br> <br>

I require a deposit to hold rats. I can not guarantee there will be babies available. The deposit is half of the adoption fee. The other part of the adoption fee is due at the time of pickup. <br> <br>

People pick their babies in the order in which deposits were sent in. People pick their babies from photos and YouTube videos. <br> <br> <br>

Deposits are nonrefundable in most cases. There are few exceptions where they are refundable; it is at a case by case basis and completely at my discretion. Your deposit lets me know you are serious about adopting rats and are fully committed to these little living beings. <br> <br> <br>

<A HREF="https://thefireflyrattery.github.io/policies.html#3"> <b> <center> -:¦:- Click For Deposit Policies -:¦:-</b> </center> </a> <br> <br> <br>

You must reverify what food and bedding you will be using along with sending a photo of your cage all setup before pickup. You can not pick your babies up until you do this. <br> <br> <br>
