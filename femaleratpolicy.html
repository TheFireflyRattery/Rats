<Font size="+2">

As you may know female rats are prone to mammary tumors. Unfortunately when they were first domesticated and bred they were bred to have tumors for laboratory work and experiments. The goal of rat breeders is to reduce the chances of mammary tumors in our lines.<p> <br>


The average rate is 50% of females getting tumors. I've worked to greatly reduce that percentage and have succeeded. But with not everyone keeping in contact it can be hard to have completely accurate data. <p> <br>


As an incentive to try and get adopters to remain in contact I have a policy for my female rats. If your girl gets a mammary tumor then I will offer you a baby for free in your next pair.* <p> <br>

I require a photo to verify the rat and a photo of her tumor. This is so I can identify the rat and see the placement of the tumor. <br>
If you have vet documentation of a tumor removal that will work as verification too. (It must show your name and have a semi current date.) <p> <br>

You do not have to get another pair right away. You can wait until you're ready. However you must inform me immediately so I can document it and adjust my breeding as needed. <p> <br>

*I reserve the right to not honor this policy at any time as I see fit. I offer this opportunity as a kindness and incentive to keep me informed. If I decline I will inform you why. (I have never refused an adopter who has provided the required proof in the history of my rattery. But I need to add this to protect my rats and myself.) <p> <br>
